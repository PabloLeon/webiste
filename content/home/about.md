I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh.
I want to understand how the (human) mind represents the world and how this representation allows generalization and transfer. To analyze this I compare human learning and generalization with performance and dynamics of machine learning algorithms and computational models.

My supervisor is [Christopher Lucas](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clucas2/). During my B.Sc. and M.Sc. I worked with [Frank Jäkel](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/models-of-higher-cognition/mod/mem/frank/index.en.jsp) at the University of Osnabrück and with [David Lagnado](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/david_lagnado.html) at UCL London.

I am currently a visiting Ph.D. student at the [Computational Cognitive Development Lab](http://www.cocodevlab.com/) at the University of Toronto, where I work with [Daphna Buchsbaum](http://www.cocodevlab.com/principal-investigator.html).
