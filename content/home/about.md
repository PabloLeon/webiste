I am a third year Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh.
I want to understand how the (human) mind represents the world and how this representation allows generalization and transfer. To analyze this I compare human learning and generalization with performance and dynamics of machine learning algorithms and computational models.

My supervisor is [Christopher Lucas](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clucas2/). During my B.Sc. and M.Sc. I worked with Frank Jäkel at the University of Osnabrück and with [David Lagnado](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/david_lagnado.html) at UCL London.
