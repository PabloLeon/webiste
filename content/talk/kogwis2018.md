# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = """In **function learning** experiments, where participants learn relationships from sequentially-presented data, people show a strong tacit expectation that most relationships are linear, and struggle to learn non-linear relationships. In contrast, **function estimation** experiments, where data are presented simultaneously, have shown that human learners can extrapolate from complex non-linear trends. Do people have different expectations in these task types?

Based on experimental data and a Bayesian model, we conclude that:
- Function learning and function estimation are fundamentally similar tasks: Differences between them can be attributed to differences in access to data -- via direct observation or memory -- rather than different inductive biases or task representations.
- People can discover the general form of a functional relationship in a memory-efficient way, while being poor at tracking the specific parameters governing the relationship.
- The tacit human preference for linear relationships may be weaker than previously supposed, with past results -- including error rates in learning non-linear relationships -- being due in part to an inability to track details of relationships.
