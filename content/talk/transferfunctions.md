# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = """Function learning (or regression) problems are ubiquitous in human experience and machine learning. Humans can generalise in diverse ways that respect the abstract structure of a problem and can use knowledge in one context to
inform decisions in another. Knowledge transfer is common in applied statistics, as when a practitioner recognises that kinds of regression problems involve certain parametric relationships. It is also at the heart of scientic progress, e.g., when analogies lead to new hypotheses and discoveries. In some situations, data are plentiful and transfer of knowledge is relatively unimportant, but when
data are sparse, having appropriate prior knowledge is essential. In this talk, I explore human-like generalisation in regression problems, using psychological experiments and probabilistic models. I present evidence that humans can learn and generalise from relationships in ways that reflect the compositional structure of those relationships.
These learned relationships are re-usable: they shape subsequent inferences and lead to structured extrapolations in the face of extremely sparse data.
I describe a model that explains qualitative features of human judgements in cases where previous models fail, and re-uses compositional representa-
tions to extrapolate from sparse data."""
