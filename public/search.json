In a direct comparison of both paradigms, we found that differences between task types can be attributed to data availability. We show that a simple memory-limited Bayesian model is consistent with human extrapolations for linear data for both high and low data availability. However, our model underestimates the participants' ability to infer non-monotonic functions, especially when data is sparse. This suggest that people track higher-order properties of functions when learning and generalizing.","tags":[],"title":"Data Availability and Function Extrapolation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495644576,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495644576,"objectID":"7768d084008c32ae07362c9758212607","permalink":"/talk/transferfunctions/","publishdate":"2017-05-24T17:49:36+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/transferfunctions/","section":"talk","summary":"Function learning (or regression) problems are ubiquitous in human experience and machine learning. Humans can generalise in diverse ways that respect the abstract structure of a problem and can use knowledge in one context to\r\ninform decisions in another. Knowledge transfer is common in applied statistics, as when a practitioner recognises that kinds of regression problems involve certain parametric relationships. It is also at the heart of scientic progress, e.g., when analogies lead to new hypotheses and discoveries. In some situations, data are plentiful and transfer of knowledge is relatively unimportant, but when\r\ndata are sparse, having appropriate prior knowledge is essential. In this talk, I explore human-like generalisation in regression problems, using psychological experiments and probabilistic models. I present evidence that humans can learn and generalise from relationships in ways that reflect the compositional structure of those relationships.\r\nThese learned relationships are re-usable: they shape subsequent inferences and lead to structured extrapolations in the face of extremely sparse data.\r\nI describe a model that explains qualitative features of human judgements in cases where previous models fail, and re-uses compositional representa-\r\ntions to extrapolate from sparse data.","tags":[],"title":"Human-like Function Learning and Transfer","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Pablo León-Villagrá","Frank Jäkel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1374943120,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1374943120,"objectID":"3df6c817c3b1e192a2b906873f35510e","permalink":"/publication/similarity-chess/","publishdate":"2013-07-27T17:38:40+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/similarity-chess/","section":"publication","summary":"Chess experts remember meaningful chess positions better than novices (de Groot, 1978; Chase \u0026 Simon, 1973). This can be explained with a larger number of chunks in experts’ long-term memory (Gobet \u0026 Simon, 1998). These chunks are mainly based on visual representations—that is, pieces on squares. However, a recent experiment highlighted that experts prefer to group chess positions by abstract similarities that cannot be explained purely visually (Linhares \u0026 Brum, 2007). Based on these data it was claimed that chess expertise, in addition to chunks, crucially relies on abstraction\r\nand analogies. These data and the conclusions\r\nwere heavily criticized because the instructions strongly biased the participants to group positions in a certain way (Bilalic \u0026 Gobet, 2009). Here, we successfully replicated this experiment with less explicit instructions. In addition, we collected category labels for the groupings that allowed us to explore the abstract principles that\r\nparticipants used.","tags":[],"title":"Categorization and Abstract Similarity in Chess","type":"publication"}]
